Performance Center Management System (C++)
This application is designed to manage a performance center that hosts circus, opera, and theater shows. Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, the system allows users to add performances, register spectators, and provide personalized recommendations based on their preferences and requirements.

Main Functionalities
1. Managing Performances
Users can add new performances to the system.
Each performance has a title, genre, duration, and ticket price.
2. Managing Spectators
Users can register spectators by entering their preferences (e.g., preferred genres, ticket budget, seating preferences).
Each spectator will receive a list of recommended performances based on their preferences.
3. Personalized Recommendations
The system matches spectators with the most suitable performances, taking into account their preferences and constraints (budget, genre, etc.).
Each spectator can view a customized list of shows that best fit their profile.
