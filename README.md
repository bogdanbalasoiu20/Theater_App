# **Performance Center Management System (C++)**  

This application is designed to **manage a performance center** that hosts **circus, opera, and theater shows**. Using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**, the system allows users to **add performances, register spectators, and provide personalized recommendations** based on their **preferences and requirements**.  

## **Main Functionalities**  

### **1. Managing Performances**  
- Users can **add new performances** to the system.  
- Each performance has a **title, genre, duration, and ticket price**.  

### **2. Managing Spectators**  
- Users can **register spectators** by entering their **preferences** (e.g., **preferred genres, ticket budget, seating preferences**).  
- Each spectator will receive a **list of recommended performances** based on their preferences.  

### **3. Personalized Recommendations**  
- The system **matches spectators with the most suitable performances**, taking into account their **preferences and constraints** (**budget, genre, etc.**).  
- Each spectator can view a **customized list of shows** that best fit their profile.
